# speak-it

SpeakIt is a project designed to make text to speech for rich text much more accurate to the authorial intent behind it.
For example, take the sentence "John *ran* to the store" which is clearly not equivalent to "John ran to the store."

Currently, most TTS engines try to solve this problem with sentiment analysis and incredibly large datasets. Instead of this, SpeakIt uses NLP techniques to provide that information in a more straightforward way.
